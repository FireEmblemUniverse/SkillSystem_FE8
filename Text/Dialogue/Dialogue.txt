[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadErika][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ah... how rare to find another soul[N]
wandering out here.[A][N]
The mushrooms are blooming after yesterday's[N]
rain. A fleeting gift from the forest.[A][N]
I come here to study fungi and wild herbs,[N]
far from the bustle of Celadon City.[A][N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadErika][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Do you like plants?[A][N]
Some are delicate... others, resilient.[A][N]
With the right balance of water, warmth,[N]
and soil, they flourish.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]But throw off that balance,[N]
and they begin to wither.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]Pokémon are not so different. Their[N]
bodies respond to all kinds of stimuli...[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]Allow me to demonstrate.[A][X]



## ErikaRematchDefeatText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadErika][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Nobody blinks an eye when[N]
