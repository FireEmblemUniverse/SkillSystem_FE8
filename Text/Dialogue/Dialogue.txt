## BrockRematchDefeatText 
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadBrock][OpenMidRight]Every town's Pokémon Gym is different![N]
Pewter Gym's design is my pride.[A][N]

deny that when you enter, the design[A][N]
has a breathtaking impact, right?[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadMisty][OpenMidRight]Hey, do you have a favorite[N]
scenic spot?[A][N]
I especially love the Cape along[N]

I've got so many memories of[N]
things along that coast...[A][N]
What kinds of memories? Pfft![N]
Like I'd tell you![A][X]

## MistyRematchDefeatText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadMisty][OpenMidRight]Hey, did you hear? If you take[N]
a stroll along Route 25 with your[A][N]
partner and stare into the pool of[N]
water, you get to make a true-love wish![A][N]
You didn't hear about that?[N]
Really?[A] Well, that would be[N]
because I just made it up! Ha ha ha![A][X]

Huh? You're here to fight?[N]
Ha ha ha! Good luck![A][N]
I tell you, kid, electric Pokémon[N]
saved me during the war![A][N]
They zapped my enemies into[N]
paralysis![A][N]
The same as I'll do to you![A][X]
	
## LtSurgeDefeatText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadLtSurge][OpenMidRight]Bah. As a reward for your win,[N]
take this Thunder Badge.[A][N]

## LtSurgeRematchText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadLtSurge][OpenMidRight]When I was fighting for my country,[N]
I helped raise a lot of trainers.[A][N]
taught 'em the ropes. I drilled[N]
'em from dawn to dusk.[A][N]
You're goin' down![A][X]


## LtSurgeRematchDefeatText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadLtSurge][OpenMidRight]Where'd you train?[N]
Who taught you how to battle?[A][N]
We need more folks like[N]
you on the force.[A][X]



## KogaChallengeText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadKoga][OpenMidRight]Fwahahaha![N]
You're but a child![A][N]
You dare challenge me?[N]

proven your worth![A][N]

## KogaRewardText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadKoga][OpenMidRight]This ancient artifact will damage[N]
nearby enemies after attacking.[A][N]
It is a secret technique dating[N]
back some four hundred years.[A][X]

## KogaRematchDefeatText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadKoga][OpenMidRight]My efforts failed again.[N]
I must hone my skills.[A][X]

## ErikaChallengeText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadErika][OpenMidRight]Ah... what lovely weather.[A][N]
The scent of blossoms always[N]
puts me at ease.[A][N]
My name is Erika. I specialize[N]
in botanical research.[N][A]
I sequence plant genomes[N]
and craft herbal remedies.[A][N]
My Pokémon help me explore the deeper[N]
truths of plants and natural healing.[A][N]
Oh... you wish to challenge me?[N]
Very well, but I shall not lose.[A][X]


## ErikaDefeatText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadErika][OpenMidRight]I concede defeat.[N]

all nearby allies.[A][N]
I hope you'll make[N]
good use of it.[A][X]


## ErikaRematchText

[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadErika][OpenMidRight]Do you like plants?[A][N]
Some are delicate... others, resilient.[A][N]
With the right balance of water, warmth,[N]
and soil, they flourish.[A][N]
But throw off that balance,[N]
and they begin to wither.[A][N]
Pokémon are not so different. Their[N]
bodies respond to all kinds of stimuli...[A][N]
Allow me to demonstrate.[A][X]



## ErikaRematchDefeatText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadErika][OpenMidRight]Nobody blinks an eye when[N]
you experiment on plants.[A][N]
But the second you use live[N]
critters as specimens, there's[A][N]
an uproar...[A][X]

//Things are easier... when they're[N]
//predictable.[A][N]
## SabrinaChallengeText
[OpenMidRight][LoadSabrina][OpenMidRight]I knew you were coming.[A][N]
I've been cursed with visions - no,[N]
experiences - since childhood.[A][N]
I don't just see them..[N]
I feel them, too.[A][N]
Prophecies, memories, sensations...[N]
I meditate to regain control.[A][N]
You're in the way of my solitude.[N]
I will now take control.[A][X]


## ShowSabrinaText

this with you.[A][X]

## SabrinaRewardText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadSabrina][OpenMidRight]This concentrates your psychic[N]
power to evade criticals.[A][N]
What? Everyone has psychic power.[N]
They just don't realize it.[A][X]

## SabrinaRematchText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadSabrina][OpenMidRight]Psychic ability is all about control.[A][N]
You close your eyes, clear your mind,[N]
and push things away.[A][N]
Just keep pushing until nothing[N]
can bother you anymore.[A][X]

## SabrinaRematchDefeatText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadSabrina][OpenMidRight]I envy you.[A][N]
Your mind is weak, but you[N]
are not afflicted by it.[A][N]
Perhaps control isn't everything.[A][X]

## BlaineSeafoamText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadProtag][OpenMidRight][LoadBlaine][OpenMidRight]Brrr...![N]
Who dares disturb my glacial exile?![A][N]
This waterfall may be cold,[N]
but my passion still burns fiery-hot![A][N]
I lost at my gym... lost my spark...[N]
So I came here to stoke the flames![A][N]

Can you believe it?[N]
I haven't given anyone a badge yet.[A][N]
[LoadGaryPoint]It's thanks to me[N]
no one's challenged you yet.[A][N]
