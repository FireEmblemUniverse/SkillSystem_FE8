Things you need:

Get a clean rom called "FE8_clean.gba" and put it in the extracted folder.
Run MAKE HACK_full when you make text or table changes, otherwise MAKE HACK_quick is enough.

How to use:
"Engine Hacks\Skill System\Skill_lists.event" has the level up skills along with which level they're learned at
"Tables\FE8 Nightmare modules" has CSVs for editing the personal skills and class skills along with things like animations and other stuff.
