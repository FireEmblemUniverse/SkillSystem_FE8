#Stores value as a word to $030004B8 + (memory slot*4). Maximum memory slot is 0xD.
#Memory slots are very important for fe8 events!
#Memory slot 0x0 always has a value of zero - don't bother setting it otherwise.
#Memory slot 0xB is where coordinates for many commands are read from.
#Memory slot 0xC is where conditional values are stored - booleans, character IDs, gold count, etc
#Memory slot 0xD indicates the size of a queue (see below); don't modify it with SETVAL

#0x062X series performs mathematical operations between memory slots.
#Using macros for these is recommended.
#Format for parameters is 0x0XYZ, where X and Y are the memory slots that supply the arguments for the equation,
#and Z is the memory slot that the results are stored to.

#This can be used to transfer a value from one slot to another; just use 0x0YZ as the parameter.
